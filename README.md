## Introduction

This is a simple web application to check the current weather conditions in the 18 provinces of Angola using the OpenWeatherMap API and the OpenStreetMap API.

## Requirements

The applicationnis only for mobile screen devices, so if your're opening in a computer, you should use an mobille screen simulator for better experience

## Observations

Some weather data might not be displayed correctly, which could be due to issues with the API. The future forecasts are only fictitious data, where only the main information comes from the API.
